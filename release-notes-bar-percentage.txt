This script will add text to bars showing the price change of the bar as percentage, both for open/close and high/low.
It can be used to better get an ideea of how the price moved at a previous point in time.
Script uses labels for text, as there is a maximum limitation of using 500 labels if you want to study price movement for a specific timeframe, you can limit the timeframe
from the script settings. Keep in mind that labels are applied to the last 500 candles of any timeframe.
Script also displays maximum statistics for the selected time period, for both green and red candles both as percentage and basecurrency absolute value.

Uses:
- Study the behaviour of an asset under previous market conditions, black swan events a.s.o.
- Calculate leverage position risk versus extreme price movements
Example: ZENUSDT pumped ~35% on 15 Sep 2021 in the first seconds after the news on getting listed on Coinbase so shorts with 3x leverage would have been liquidated.
